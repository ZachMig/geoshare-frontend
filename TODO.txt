dont forget to:

make popup are u sure to delete location maybe idk

refresh locationpreview same way as refreshing locations when myLists is reloaded, currently reloads on user switch at least
also needs to refresh after location edit

return user data storage to localstorage for cross-tab access, and also remember to clear it on logout() call

make lists editable/deleteable

in the public search, indicate who owns the searched lists

BUG? user auth state can persist from last session but new instance of spring app? shouldn't be relevant in prod I think

maybe look at filtereddropdown placeholder looking like real value

make new list search clear selectedList, etc

turn off strict mode when project finished
