move selectedLocation back into wherever the actions where the delete is called because it's deleting the wrong location becasue sync 
still working on this
Ok maybe it's fixed just leaving this here so I can try to break it more later

make popup are u sure to delete location maybe idk

return user data storage to localstorage for cross-tab access, and also remember to clear it on logout() call

in the public search, indicate who owns the searched lists?

add field to location table to track how many lists it belongs to, so we can easily check if a location needs to be marked unlisted

figure out a good way to do sorting of displayed lists/locations? date?

make emails unique in db?

turn off strict mode when project finished
