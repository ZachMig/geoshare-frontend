dont forget to:

in the public search, indicate who owns the searched lists?

add field to location table to track how many lists it belongs to, so we can easily check if a location needs to be marked unlisted

figure out a good way to do sorting of displayed lists/locations? date?

make emails unique in db?

Make list description a popout or fade in instead of jarring appear in your face

arrow key nav is still bad since it goes out of range anyway (Fixed?)

**Can now drop the unique constraint in db for list.user_id + list.name
