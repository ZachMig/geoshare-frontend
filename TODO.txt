dont forget to:


**********
move selectedLocation back into wherever the actions where the delete is called because it's deleting the wrong location becasue sync 
**********
^^ still working on this

also some lists are not being marked unlisted correctly after unlink requests

make popup are u sure to delete location maybe idk

refresh locationpreview same way as refreshing locations when myLists is reloaded, currently reloads on user switch at least
also needs to refresh after location edit

return user data storage to localstorage for cross-tab access, and also remember to clear it on logout() call

in the public search, indicate who owns the searched lists?

BUG? user auth state can persist from last session but new instance of spring app? shouldn't be relevant in prod I think

make new list search clear selectedList, etc

add field to location table to track how many lists it belongs to, so we can easily check if a location needs to be marked unlisted

turn off strict mode when project finished
