dont forget to:

return user data storage to localstorage for cross-tab access, and also remember to clear it on logout() call

in the public search, indicate who owns the searched lists?

add field to location table to track how many lists it belongs to, so we can easily check if a location needs to be marked unlisted

figure out a good way to do sorting of displayed lists/locations? date?

make emails unique in db?
